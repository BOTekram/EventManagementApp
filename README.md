# Event Management App 

## Suppose you are working for a software company, and a new client who is in the Events industry wants you to develop an Android application for their company. They need an Event Management Application that will help them see the different events that they organise.

## This Events management app needs to take two types of input data (Entities (Objects)) from Event Organisers:

## Event Category: What kind of an event is this?
## Event: What is the event? 

## After adding the events, you can see the location of the event in google maps, and also can tap the fragment to search for the event in the internet  

### Datas are saved using Room Persistence Library SQLite, Rooms, and LiveData
